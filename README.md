Here is a simple video game I created with the help of an artist who drew all the sprites.
The game has 2 different modes, a running mode which is similar to the google chrome dinosaur game but with a few added twists and the second game mode being a shooter game where you have to scale a small level and beat the boss
Here's a link to the game:
